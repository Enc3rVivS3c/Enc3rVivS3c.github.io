# Hello, cyber enthusiasts and curious minds!
Welcome to my very first blog post on my exciting journey into the world of cybersecurity. I am thrilled to share with you my experiences, challenges, and triumphs as I make the transition from a background in physical security to the dynamic realm of cyber security. Join me as I embark on this exhilarating adventure, learning the ropes of digital defence, attack and exploring the fascinating world of cyber threats, vulnerabilities, and solutions.

## Who Am I?
First, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Enc3r Viv S3c, and for years, I've been deeply engrossed in the field of physical security. The thrill of ensuring the safety of people, places, and assets has been my passion and driving force. From access control systems to surveillance strategies, I've dedicated myself to the art of safeguarding the physical world.
## Why Cyber Security?
In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, it's become increasingly evident that security isn't confined solely to the physical realm. With the rise of technology and interconnected systems, the world has become more vulnerable to cyber attacks than ever before. Recognising this paradigm shift, I've decided to pivot my expertise and delve headfirst into cyber security.
My goal is to bridge the knowledge gap between the two domains and contribute to creating a more secure environment, both online and offline. As I take my first steps into the world of cyber security, I anticipate that my background in physical security will provide a unique perspective, allowing me to draw parallels and apply lessons from my previous experiences.
